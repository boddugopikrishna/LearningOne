1)A letter means push and an asterisk means pop in the
following sequence.  Give the sequence of values returned by the pop operations
when this sequence of operations is performed on an initially empty LIFO stack.
         E A S * Y * Q U E * * * S T * * * I O * N * * *
2)Write a program that reads in a sequence of characters and prints them
    in reverse order.  Use a stack

3)Write a program that reads in a sequence of characters, and determines whether
    its parentheses, braces, and curly braces are "balanced."  Hint:  for left
    delimiters, push onto stack; for right delimiters, pop from stack and check
    whether popped element matches right delimiter.

4) Write a program that reads in a positive integer and prints the binary
    representation of that integer.  Hint:  divide the integer by 2.

5) Add an interface function void STACKmultipop(int k) that pops k elements from
    the stack, or until the stack is empty.
